                <p>They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your
                    destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always! Boy you said it,
                    Chewie. Where did you dig up that old fossil? Ben is a great man. Yeah, great at getting us into
                    trouble. I didn't hear you give any ideas... Well, anything would be better than just hanging around
                    waiting for him to pick us up... Who do you think...</p>

                <div class="sunrise-time">
                    <p>The time of sunrise on your location: <span id="sunriseTime" class="underline"></span> !</p>
                </div>
                <p>I'm not going anywhere. They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said you didn't
                    want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to do is stay. Marching into the detention
                    area is not what I had in mind. But they're going to kill her! Better her than me... She's rich.
                    Rich? Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the reward would be... What? Well more
                    wealth that you can imagine. I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit! You'll get it! I better! You
                    will...</p>

                <p>The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver straight down this trench and skim the
                    surface to this point. The target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust port,
                    right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the reactor system. A precise hit will start
                    a chain reaction which should destroy the station. Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction.
                    The shaft is ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible, even for a
                    computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my T-sixteen back home. They're not
                    much bigger than two meters. Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!</p>

                <p>I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or this is going to be a real short trip.
                    Okay, hit it! We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off! Angle the deflector shields while I
                    charge up the main guns! I can't believe he's gone. There wasn't anything you could have done. Come
                    on, buddy, we're not out of this yet! You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!</p>

                <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is
                    not his plan. I must face him alone.</p>
